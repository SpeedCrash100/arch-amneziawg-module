# Arch linux package for building AmneziaWG kernel module


## Warning

This package downloads the kernel source for currently kernel you running. 
It means after you updated kernel, you need to rebuild the package after booted into new kernel.


## ToDo:
 - [ ] Get kernel sources for installed kernels instead running one
 - [ ] DKMS support if possible(Mostly likely is not or not viable)
